## group presentation feedback


### What your classmates liked:

-What did you like about this app? 
- Added difficulty options to game. Shiny reactive plot. Incorporates algorithm for game, and different levels.
- I liked that this app used 3 different algorithms to play tic tac toe, I also liked that it provided a lot of background information for the user
- For the Tic-Tac-Toe group, they give some instruction and information about how to play the game and they also provide hint about how to win, which is very thoughtful. The game interface looks nice.
the subject matter was interesting and well thought out
- I'm not sure which group this is referencing but I will assume this should be tic tac toe group, I like the theory and idea behind their app 
- Cool that it uses an algorithm to modify the difficulty of the game, but in the presentation it was not clear how exactly it works
- I liked the medium level that blocks the user instead of being random "
- It's an interesting app. I like the part that they divided the game into three modes(easy, medium, hard). They also have game instruction.
- Nice game. 
- he change in levels was intresting and how tricky it got to beat the computer with a well written code. - I think the game was interesting, I want to know more about the algorithm used since I think that was the main innovation? 
- A really fun game that with different levels of difficulty.
- Game app, refreshing since it is not a research-based app. 
- nice use of concepts learnt in and out of class
- nice game app
- nice help tab and instruction - novice user can learn how to play easily
- simplicity
- Nicely designed and the game is properly introduced.

### Suggested improvements


- I don't think there was any output when there was a tie game, maybe add something in so that the users know the game has ended in a tie.
- When I pull the app from github, it also let me to install some packages so that it can run successfully. Can the app install their dependent packages automatically? And they can let the users set the game rule individually. Such as generating more grids and set the win rule as more same patterns in a line.
- I think instructions need to be detailed and the layout of the page should be improved
- Iâ€™d be nice to reorganize the tabs so that the instructions and information are before the actual game
- many times they win and then draw a plot to show data visualization.
- Make it more difficult?
- Computer vs computer simulation tab
- A better introduction for gam e rules.
- Fix 'computer player' response. They should include more functionalities. 
- play around with  colors to improve UX
- none
- More content can be added to this app. It's a little empty right now.




## Changes before turning it in 

- adjust your instructions tab to make this layed out better. 
- maybe include screenshots of game play
- In the hard mode, there is a bug, if I go to use your figure 1 structure I can beat it in hard everytime. I start with top left, then click center, then bottom left and I can win each time this way.
