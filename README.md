# Tic Tac Toe Shiny App

Tic Tac Toe is a fun game where two players battle to get three of their symbols in a row before the other person does in a 3 by 3 grid. This shiny app allows users to play against a computer in 4 different levels ranging from easy to a challenge level, in which users will pretty much almost never win against the computer. The harder levels were made using an algorithm called minimax, described in our tab about the game. Users can also check out hints about how they might want to win in our hints tab. This app was designed in a friendly, fun way for everyone to play!

To begin, users simply go to the game tab and enter the level they want to play on the side. To play a game, simply reset and do this again. **NOTE: THIS GAME IS BEST PLAYED IN BROWSER MODE**
